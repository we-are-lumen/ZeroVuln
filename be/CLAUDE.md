# 0G Agent Skills

You are assisting a developer building on the **0G decentralized AI operating system**. This
repository contains 14 agent skills across 4 categories: Storage, Compute, Chain, and Cross-Layer.

## How to Use

1. Read `AGENTS.md` for orchestration rules, activation triggers, and workflow sequences
2. Load the relevant `SKILL.md` file based on what the developer is building
3. Reference `patterns/*.md` for deep architectural context
4. Follow ALL ALWAYS/NEVER rules — they prevent common bugs

## Critical Rules (Memorize These)

- **processResponse()**: Call after EVERY compute inference. Param order:
  `(providerAddress, chatID, usageData)`
- **ChatID**: Extract from `ZG-Res-Key` header FIRST, `data.id` as fallback (chatbot only)
- **evmVersion**: ALWAYS use `"cancun"` for 0G Chain contracts
- **ethers**: ALWAYS v6 (`ethers.JsonRpcProvider`, `ethers.parseEther`). NEVER v5
- **File handles**: ALWAYS close `ZgFile` with `file.close()` in a `finally` block
- **Private keys**: ALWAYS from `.env`, NEVER hardcoded
- **Upload signature**: `indexer.upload(file, rpcUrl, signer)` — returns `[result, error]` tuple
- **Download behavior**: `indexer.download()` can THROW in addition to returning errors — always
  wrap in try/catch
- **Service tuples**: `listService()` returns tuple arrays, not objects — use `s[0]` for
  providerAddress, `s[1]` for serviceType, `s[6]` for model, `s[10]` for teeVerified
- **Ledger tuples**: `getLedger()` returns tuple — use `account[1]` for totalBalance, `account[2]`
  for availableBalance

### Cross-Layer

- `skills/cross-layer/storage-plus-chain/SKILL.md` — On-chain refs to off-chain data
- `skills/cross-layer/compute-plus-storage/SKILL.md` — AI inference + storage I/O

## Pattern Documents

- `patterns/NETWORK_CONFIG.md` — Endpoints, chain IDs, SDK versions, .env template
- `patterns/STORAGE.md` — Storage architecture & SDK reference
- `patterns/COMPUTE.md` — Compute architecture & processResponse() deep-dive
- `patterns/CHAIN.md` — EVM patterns, Hardhat/Foundry configs, ethers v6
- `patterns/SECURITY.md` — Key management, TEE, data integrity
- `patterns/TESTING.md` — Testing strategies & mock patterns

## Quick Start

When a developer asks to build something on 0G:

1. Check `AGENTS.md` workflow sequences to determine which skills to activate
2. Load the primary skill's `SKILL.md`
3. Load `patterns/NETWORK_CONFIG.md` for environment setup
4. Follow the skill's Quick Workflow section
5. Apply all ALWAYS/NEVER rules from `AGENTS.md`
